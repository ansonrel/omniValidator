## Omnibenchmark schemas and requirements

This folder contains all JSON schemas and requirements list for the output files generated by an `Omnibenchmark project`. 

The files are first organized **per benchmark** secondly **per keyword**. Each of these combinations contains an `output/requirements.json` file specifying the list of required output files for a particular combination of benchmark/ keyword (e.g. `data` for `omni_batch_py`) as well as additional metadata to guide the user.
